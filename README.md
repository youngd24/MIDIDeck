# The MIDI Deck


What is it? an Arduino Pro Micro MIDI controller, connected via USB, that can send MIDI messages to a host on button press. The idea is to automate apps on the host, in my primary use case, OBS. Press button, things happen.

The design is as dead simple as possible so it's easy to build, total cost is under $20 (likely less).
